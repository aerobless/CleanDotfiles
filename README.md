dotfiles for OS X
=================

This repository contains a bunch of dotfiles that I'm using on my Macs. Some functions/aliases will work on any Unix OS while others are specifically for OS X.

## My Setup
To keep the custom aliases/etc. in sync across multiple Macs I keep them in a Dropbox folder. The main .bash\_profile in my user directory simply links to the location of "bash\_profile.sh".

## Essential utilities
 + [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
